## Description

<p>Hyperloop UC is University of Cincinnati's Hyperloop team which participated in SpaceX Hyperloop competition.</p>

<p>I worked as a member on Software Team before becoming the Team Lead. My responsibilities as a software engineer ranged from working with sensors, testing serial communication between microcontrollers to socket communication.</p>

<p>As the software team lead, I led discussions regarding the planning of the software system. I was reponsible in delegating tasks and following up with members and ensuring we could achieve deliverables.</p>
