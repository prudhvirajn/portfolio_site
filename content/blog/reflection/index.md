### Summary

<p>At the start of my college, I was unsure what path in Computer Science I would end up taking. During my sophomore year, I did a project on tracking fingers using OpenCV and Python for Intro to Python class. I was still limited to online courses and textbooks. In Spring 2019, I got a chance to coop in Singapore with Omniaz. I was plunged into the deep end of machine learning problems. During my time at Omniaz, I got into the habit of reading research papers and finding implementations of object detection solutions and eventually other computer vision solutions. </p>

<p>Currently, I am working on my senior design project focused on understanding how image classification neural networks when data is distorted with various distortion algorithms. I will graduate this Spring semester and hope to find an internship for summer!</p>

<p>If I were to start again, I would only apply for more opportunities and reach out to more people!!</p>
