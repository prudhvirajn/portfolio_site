## Description

<p>I tutored students one-on-one for Calculus I & II, Intro to Statistics, Intro to Physics, Intro to Chemistry, Intro to Python, Intro to Java.</p>

<p>I would understand the student's requirements regarding specific topics or questions. Then we would plan out the study session to ensure that the student could grasp the topic or would require further sessions.</p>

<p>During the session, I would ask the student to try and explain their understanding of the topic. Converse with them if they have any missing blocks in their understanding. Then, we would work on example problems. Afterwards, the student would demonstrate that they have learnt the topic by solving and explaning the solution to a problem.</p>

### Technical Concept Learned 

<p>I gained a deeper understanding for Calculus and Statistics.</p>

### Non-Technical Concept Learned

<p>I learnt to understand another person's requirements</p>
