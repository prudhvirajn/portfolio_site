## Description

<p>I was on the event planning committee for UC Relay for Life. UC Relay for Life is an event which seeks to raise cancer awareness amongst college students.</p>

<p>I was responsible for finding potential caterers for the event. On event day, I handled student registration, setup tents and sold drinks to raise money for charity.</p>
